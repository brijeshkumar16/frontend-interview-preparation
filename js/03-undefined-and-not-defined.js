//! What is the difference between undefined and is not defined?
// In JavaScript, undefined is a value that indicates that a variable or property has not been assigned a value.

// On the other hand, "is not defined" is a reference error that occurs because the variable or property is not defined in the current scope, and it cannot be accessed.

let x;
console.log(x); // logs "undefined"

console.log(y); // throws "ReferenceError: y is not defined"
